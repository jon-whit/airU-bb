=====
The airU project is an interdisciplinary project by University of Utah Computer Science, Chemical Engineering, and Computer Engineering students who have designed a low cost air-quality sensor platform that is suited to improving our understanding of the Wasatch Frontâ€™s air quality challenges.  The project hopes to provide:

- A broad collection of air quality data, with tools that enable individuals to visualize, interpret, and download real-time data interactively.
- Low cost air quality stations that can communicate wireless with centralized databases (be it government or commercial)
- Innovative transportation routes based on air quality index rating (long term)
